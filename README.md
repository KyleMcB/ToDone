Android app to track/measure habits to create and maintian health lifestyle choices

This app has two purposes: I need an app to help me track good and bad habits to improve my life, and to help me get a software engineering job.
I used jetpack compose which is a react style UI library to create UIs in a declaritive manor. Most jobs I have found want experience with the older xml layout style UI system.
So, I am marking this prototype finished and will be recreating it with the xml layout system. Also I will using sqlite instead serializing all memory to json and saving that in a file,
and finally I will be using TDD to recreate it. In the mean time this prototype is already helping me track and maintain good habits like exercising and taking my dog out for walks regularly.
